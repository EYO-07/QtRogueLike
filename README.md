# QtRogueLike (in-development)
Mixed genre between Roguelike and Turn Based Strategy using Python 3.12 and the libraries PyQt5 and noise.

Python 3.12, maybe works on older versions (not tested).
Use dependencies.bat to install the requirements (PyQt5, noise) on windows, or manually install using pip ( pip install PyQt5, pip install noise ).

Double-click on start.pyw to play or in cmd type (python start.pyw).

Currently in development, but I will appreciate if someone help testing the game ;)
