# QtRogueLike 
Python Rogue-Like game using PyQt5.

Python 3.12, maybe works on older versions (not tested).

Use dependencies.bat to install the requirements (PyQt5, noise). Or manually install using pip ( pip install PyQt5, pip install noise ).

Double-click on start.pyw to play or in cmd type (python start.pyw).

Currently in development, but I will appreciate if someone help testing the game ;)

## Features (They are just conceptually applied, will be improved over time)
1. Infinite Procedurally Generated Overworld.
2. No leveling system.
3. Survival Elements (Hunger).
4. Multi-level Dungeons.
